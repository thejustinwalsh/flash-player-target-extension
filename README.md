# Flash Player Target Extension
Flash CS6 Extension for adding support for flash player 11.5, 11.6, and 11.7 to the Publish Settings

## About
CS6 is lacking the ability to manage flash player versions and this extension is attempting to ease your pain by at least allowing you to publish a swf targeting newer versions of the flash player

## Building
Open flash-player-target.mxi in the Adobe Extension Manager and save the extension to the location of your choice. I find it easiest to open the mxi file by double clicking it.

## Installation
Double click flash-player-target.zxp and follow the instructions in the Adobe Extension Manager. Once installed you will find all the latest versions of the flash player are available to you in the `Target` drop-down located on the `File -> Publish Settings...` dialog.

## Considerations
This extension does not replace the default flash player used when testing your movie within flash player.

## License
Flash Player Target Extension is license under a permissive MIT source license. Fork well my friends.
